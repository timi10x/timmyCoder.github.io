# ====================================
# TEST .htaccess - Absolute Minimum
# If this doesn't work, there's a server issue
# ====================================

# Just set the index file
DirectoryIndex index.html

# Prevent directory listing
Options -Indexes

# That's it! If this doesn't work, the issue is:
# 1. Files not uploaded correctly
# 2. Wrong directory
# 3. Server configuration problem
# 4. Domain not pointing to correct location
